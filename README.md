Project Overview

This project investigates the properties of thin films, with a focus on their thickness, deposition methods, and optical characteristics like the refractive index and optical bandgap. Data was gathered through various analysis methods and is presented in this repository.

Key Features

Thin Film Thickness: Analysis of how film thickness is influenced by deposition methods.

Deposition Methods: Focus on Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) and its effect on thin film properties.

Roughness vs. Thickness: Exploration of the relationship between surface roughness and thickness during deposition.

Temperature Effects: Analysis of how different temperatures impact the deposition rate of thin films.

Optical Properties: Detailed study of the optical bandgap for different thin films, with TiOâ‚‚ showing the highest optical bandgap.


Technologies Used

Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD)

Optical Bandgap Measurement

Temperature-Dependent Deposition Analysis

Data Visualization Tools (e.g., Excel)


Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/thin-film-analysis.git

Make sure to have the necessary tools installed for data analysis and visualization. You can use tools like Excel, Python (for data handling and plotting), or any other software suitable for scientific analysis.

How to Use

1. Presentation: The project includes a presentation file (Thin Film.pdf) that provides a comprehensive overview of the key findings and analysis.


2. Data Analysis: The repository includes data files for thin film thickness, roughness, temperature effects, and optical properties.


3. Modify: Feel free to modify the data or presentation to explore other variables or refine the analysis.



Future Work

Future enhancements of this project may include:

Further exploration of deposition methods and their effect on additional optical properties.

Use of machine learning techniques to predict thin film properties based on various input parameters.
